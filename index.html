        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">BiologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am passionate about biology because it is the most tangible of all the natural sciences.  For example, I can see how the human body functions, or think concretely about cellular processes, or consider how ecological systems fit together.  Also, I am interested in the interplay of medicine and technology.  This interest in the medical field has led to my desire to become a doctor.  To gain more experience in the medical field, I am looking for a pre-med related internship.<br><br>

I have experience volunteering, interning, and participating in many medical-related events.  First, I have been a student volunteer at Fountain Valley Hospital for more than two years.  In that capacity, I conducted rounds with patients to assist them with their basic care needs.  I also operated the nurse call systems in different hospital departments, helping out both doctors and nurses in taking care of their patients.
<br><br>

        Another experience I have is participating in the UCI Summer Surgery Program.  I was able to observe many complicated surgeries, interact with medical students, doctors, and staff, as well as practicing surgical skills for the future.  The most memorable surgeries I witnessed were a craniotomy and a hip replacement; both were sights I never could have imagined seeing up close (the surgeonâ€™s commentaries were very insightful to my learning).<br><br>  

I have also worked at Family Optometry of Irvine as a paid intern.  I interacted with patients and assisted with office operations, which gave me a better understanding of the eye care industry.  My optometry internship inspired me to write a 15 page research paper about the impact of vision impairment on overall patient health. Although vision is so important to well-being, there are issues of accessibility for a large portion of the population in the United States.
<br><br>

        In addition to these activities, I have begun my research assistant position at the UCR Brain Game Center this spring quarter.  So far, I have tested and assisted in the feedback of multiple brain-training games, interacting with actual participants through testing them on the games through zoom, as well as researching and writing papers on neuroscience-related studies.  As a student on the pre-med track, I chose this neuroscience-related research because I felt that it was more applicable and practical to my long-term goals than a regular protein synthesis lab.  Not only am I able to learn more about the brain and possible methods to improve multiple cognitive functions through gaming, the participant interaction I experience every session helps with skills I will need in the future as a doctor.<br><br>

I have many skills that can be useful in an internship/volunteer/job position.  I can proficiently use all of Microsoft office (excel, powerpoint, word) as well as its google counterparts (sheets, slides, docs).  I have great public speaking, leadership, and interaction skills from my experience of volunteering in hospitals, school clubs, and taking debate classes.  Not to mention, I am CPR certified from my time at the UCI Summer Surgery Program.
